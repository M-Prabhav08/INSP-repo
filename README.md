# Integrated Network Security Platform

## Overview
The Integrated Network Security Platform is a comprehensive tool designed to provide network administrators with the necessary tools to monitor, analyze, and secure their network infrastructure. The platform consists of six modules, each addressing different aspects of network security and management.

## Modules
### Module 1: Packet Sniffer & Analysis Toolkit
- **Description:** Allows users to capture and analyze network packets in real-time.
- **Functionality:** Users can start packet capture, view captured packets, and analyze network traffic for security and performance purposes.

### Module 2: Packet Sender
- **Description:** Facilitates sending custom network packets to specific destinations.
- **Functionality:** Users can specify packet parameters such as source/destination IP, protocol, and payload, and send packets to target hosts for various purposes, including testing and troubleshooting.

### Module 3: Network Scanner
- **Description:** Scans the network to discover connected devices and gather information about them.
- **Functionality:** Users can initiate network scans to identify devices on the network, view their IP and MAC addresses, and analyze network topology.

### Module 4: Vulnerability Scanner
- **Description:** Identifies vulnerabilities in network devices and services.
- **Functionality:** Users can specify target IP addresses to scan for vulnerabilities. The scanner checks for known vulnerabilities and provides reports on potential security risks.

### Module 5: Routing Table Viewer
- **Description:** Displays the routing table of the network.
- **Functionality:** Users can view the current routing table to understand how packets are routed within the network.

### Module 6: Network Monitoring & Analysis
- **Description:** Monitors network traffic in real-time and provides insights into bandwidth usage and protocol distribution.
- **Functionality:** Users can visualize network traffic data, including bandwidth usage and protocol distribution, through interactive graphs. This allows for proactive network management and security analysis.
