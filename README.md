# Integrated Network Security Platform

## Overview
The Integrated Network Security Platform is a comprehensive tool designed to provide network administrators with the necessary tools to monitor, analyze, and secure their network infrastructure. Developed using the **Waterfall Model** of the software development lifecycle, this platform ensures a structured and sequential approach, leading to a robust and well-tested product. The platform consists of six modules, each addressing different aspects of network security and management.

## Current Version
**P1V1.3**

## Modules
### Module 1: Packet Sniffer & Analysis Toolkit
- **Description:** Capture and analyze network packets in real-time.
- **Functionality:** Start packet capture, view captured packets, and analyze network traffic for security and performance purposes.

### Module 2: Packet Sender
- **Description:** Send custom network packets to specific destinations.
- **Functionality:** Specify packet parameters such as source/destination IP, protocol, and payload, and send packets to target hosts for testing and troubleshooting.

### Module 3: Network Scanner
- **Description:** Scan the network to discover connected devices and gather information.
- **Functionality:** Initiate network scans to identify devices on the network, view their IP and MAC addresses, and analyze network topology.

### Module 4: Vulnerability Scanner
- **Description:** Identify vulnerabilities in network devices and services.
- **Functionality:** Specify target IP addresses to scan for vulnerabilities. The scanner checks for known vulnerabilities and provides reports on potential security risks.

### Module 5: Routing Table Viewer
- **Description:** Display the routing table of the network.
- **Functionality:** View the current routing table to understand how packets are routed within the network.

### Module 6: Network Monitoring & Analysis
- **Description:** Monitor network traffic in real-time and gain insights into bandwidth usage and protocol distribution.
- **Functionality:** Visualize network traffic data, including bandwidth usage and protocol distribution, through interactive graphs for proactive network management and security analysis.
